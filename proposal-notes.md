### Misc Notes from Dan

#### Testing
typo: Testing is a critical piece of any application stack.  Not only does proper testing ensure that the application works as anticipating, but it provides documentation  for the code base while forcing clean structure upon developers.


#### How we would build the site
For the demo site, we would reimplement the community site using Squarespace, a mobile-friendly, beautiful design templating engine that allows for easy customization.

yea I also think we need to explain to them how we’d do the real site

I’d break it down into to portions. one regarding the demo site.
the second one should regard the real site.

Focus on highlighting the demo site, the work in it as well as what it’s attempting to do regarding what we talked about.
particularly we can mention what makes us confident each page is right.
For example the “my profile” page takes a good look at reviews, publications, accolades, and media.
A product company page features their storefront their accolades and press as well as their featured product and the remainder of their catalog

#### Feedback for the current site
also we should add a download model drop down that has a few modeling software options in the drop down
that way products can be exported.
We may want to find a company like KI as well as an industrial company that makes HVAC systems.
Potentially someone that sources raw materials like wood as well.
so we have three product companies
