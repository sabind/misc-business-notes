## Outstanding Questions for Joelle

#### Product Vision
During our call, we discussed the potential for exciting integrations with BMI tools to create an online catalog that the 
build industry can use during their process.  In reading the RFP, we noticed that this feature was not mentioned.  

- How do you imagine this feature fitting In with the exiting feature requirements in the RFP?  
- Is the BMI integration the major goal, or is the social component?  

We can see them being extremely complimentary, where the main focus is the discoverability of products through catalogs and 
their CAD model counterparts, and the social component is the feedback on the products and services rendered.  This could be a 
huge marketing opportunity to vendors (Gensler, KI, Herman Miller, etc.)  where they can build qualified leads based on users 
utilizing their models.  

#### History of Project
During our research, we stumbled up on the old ReSources website.  You also mentioned that the founders have had this idea 
for a while, but only recently has the technology caught up with their vision.  

- Which technologies do they feel are the most critical now that were not available previously?  
- How do those technologies correspond to the requirements as listed in the RFP?

#### NeoCon
The RFP mentions NeoCon in June, but we also discussed a future meeting with investors.  

- Are these two events both taking place at NeoCon, or does one happen before the other?  
- What are the requirements that make the presence at NeoCon a success?  
- The RFP mentions interested parties, but does that include both vendors (Gensler, KI) and end users (consumers)? 

#### Misc.
- What are the exact requirements for extending of the wordpress Site?
- How is the product going to be to profitable?  How will it make money if it is just a social community like the RFP states?
