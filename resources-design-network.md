## Outstanding Questions for Joelle

#### Product Vision
During our call, we discussed the potential for exciting integrations with BMI tools to create an online catalog that the 
build industry can use during their process.  In reading the RFP, we noticed that this feature was not mentioned.  

- How do you imagine this feature fitting In with the exiting feature requirements in the RFP?  
- Is the BMI integration the major goal, or is the social component?  

> RFP is mostly for getting the word press site up and running so they can present it. 
  They're looking for product visionaries as well as technical expertise, but the *real* engineering work wont come until 
  after they get investment (i.e., after the demos)
  
  Login in not necessary for demo site
  

We can see them being extremely complimentary, where the main focus is the discoverability of products through catalogs and 
their CAD model counterparts, and the social component is the feedback on the products and services rendered.  This could be a 
huge marketing opportunity to vendors (Gensler, KI, Herman Miller, etc.)  where they can build qualified leads based on users 
utilizing their models.  

#### History of Project
During our research, we stumbled up on the old ReSources website.  You also mentioned that the founders have had this idea 
for a while, but only recently has the technology caught up with their vision.  

- Which technologies do they feel are the most critical now that were not available previously?  
- How do those technologies correspond to the requirements as listed in the RFP?

> History goes back to the late 90s. Someone wanted to buy the idea, actually, but then the transaction never went through 
  because of the techn bubble burst. 
  
  Russ is a visionary, but also very much a "Don Draper".  He is *not* technical.
  Was referred to Joelle because he has put a lot of money into this dream but is disappointed in the outcome so far.

#### NeoCon
The RFP mentions NeoCon in June, but we also discussed a future meeting with investors.  

- Are these two events both taking place at NeoCon, or does one happen before the other?  
- What are the requirements that make the presence at NeoCon a success?  
- The RFP mentions interested parties, but does that include both vendors (Gensler, KI) and end users (consumers)? 

> NeoCon comes first, talk with investors after. 
  Will talk to people like Gensler at NeoCon
  Absolutely *must* have registration so they can get their contact information

#### Misc.
- What are the exact requirements for extending of the wordpress Site?
- How is the product going to be to profitable?  How will it make money if it is just a social community like the RFP states?
